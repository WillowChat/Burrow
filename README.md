# Burrow
Kotlin (JVM targeted) IRC v3.2 daemon. Relies heavily on [Kale](https://github.com/willowchat/kale) for message parsing and serialising. Pre 1.0 - probably not useful right now.

Project management (including features, in-progress work and goals) is done [on Trello](https://crrt.io/burrow-pm), and [Issues](https://github.com/WillowChat/Burrow/issues) are for bugs only. If you'd like to suggest a feature, talk to me on IRC at `#carrot/irc.imaginarynet.uk`.

## Goals:
* Be a suitable replacement for mostly untested and memory-unsafe C-style daemons, for small to mid-sized networks
* Make IRC daemon development easier, by focusing on software quality and maintainability, sometimes at the expense of scaling to thousands of simultaneous active clients
* Verify server behaviour with an extensive suite of unit and integration tests, realised by practising some form of TDD
